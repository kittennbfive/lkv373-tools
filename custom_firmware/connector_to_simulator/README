This is a custom firmware that allows to read/write arbitrary memory locations using a binary (for speed) protocol (briefly documented in parser.h).
It is used to connect to the simulator to pass register r/w for the MAC to the real device.

You can also interface it using the Perl-script in /serial_interface.
