This are some notes on how to get newlib and GCC running for the TF-680.

Filipe Laíns "FFY00" provides packages for binutils, GCC and newlib for NDS32 for Arch Linux (Thank you for your help!). However these are compiled for a more modern processor version than we have on the TF-680 so we need to recompile everything.

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY! YOU MAY BRICK YOUR DEVICE!

Howto:
0) set up Arch Linux (a virtual machine is fine) with package "base-devel" installed.
If you don't know anything about Arch don't be scared, i was able to do it, just follow the instructions from their very good wiki.
1) To speed things up later you can edit /etc/makepkg.conf: Uncomment the line MAKEFLAGS and change the -j2 (or whatever number) to match the number of processor cores you have.
2) Install nds32le-elf-binutils (kindly provided by FFY00) from the repository using pacman
3) [maybe you need to install nds32le-elf-gcc too for building newlib, not sure, just try without and see...]
4) go into folder "newlib" and execute (no need for root) makepkg. This will compile and package newlib.
5) Become root ("su") and install package: pacman -U nds32le-elf-newlib-3.3.0-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
We now need to rebuild GCC for NDS32 as it is linked (or whatever) against (the modified) newlib. This is a 2-step process.
6) go into folder gcc_bootstrap and execute makepkg -p PKGBUILD.bootstrap
7) install as shown above
8) go into folder gcc and do the same thing.

Now you should have a working GCC and newlib for TF-680. You can now compile the Hello World-Example and flash it using the web-UI on 192.168.168.55 or 192.168.168.221 if the bootloader is running.

If you have trouble with makepkg complaining about an unknown GPG-key for GCC just add --skippgpcheck to the makepkg-call. The better way of course is to add the key to your computer using gpg --recv-key A328C3A2C3C45C06 but this did not work for me.

If something does not work first look on the internet for solutions and if you can't solve the problem this way you may ask on freenode for help.
