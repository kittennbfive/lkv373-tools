BLOCK2 - CALLS TO OSTaskCreate() or something similar
ALL NUMBERS ARE HEX

MANUALLY COPIED FROM SIMULATOR - MIGHT BE WRONG

	r0		r1		r2		r3		r4		r5		name/function
0)	89378	75c0	3		b		12c		0		TF_MAIN
1)	d520c	1d994	0		a		3e8		1		Net (not in TCBTable??)
2)	8938c	3edc4	2		36		199		1		unknown Task / unknown purpose (someth. with MAC)
3)	89380	6564	5		d		c8		1		TF_AV
4)	8937c	cbd8	4		e		1f4		1		TF_Console
5)	89390	ee54	5		10		c8		1		TF_HTTP
6)	89388	7330	0		11		c8		1		TF_TFVEP
7)	89384	5dd8	6		f		7d0		1		unknown Task / u. p.


r0 is some memory-addr
r1 is the callback to the actual Task code
r3 is probably the priority of the task (also called ID by myself)
meaning of other registers is unknown

The TaskControlBlockTable is at d0b74 and has 22 entries of 92 bytes each. It looks like only 10 entries are used (7 tasks + 3 system tasks).

The exact meaning of each byte is unknown as we don't know what version of OS-II and what options were used.

guesses:
+0: ptr to top of stack
+4: ptr to user defined data(??)
+8: ptr to bottom of stack
+c: ?? should be stack size but the number does not make sense
+10: options from OSTaskCreateExt?
+12: Task ID - this matches r3 from above
+14: ptr to previous TCB
+18: ptr to next TCB

+4c: name of task (only used for internal tasks)


The OSRdyTbl[OS_RDY_TBL_SIZE] - Table of tasks which are ready to run - might be at cfefc. OS_RDY_TBL_SIZE might be 8 so total size is 8*1=8 bytes

The OSTCBPrioTbl of size 4x64==128 might be at d135c.

The priority resolution table (fixed, 256 bytes) is at 1b10.


some various variables, lots of guesses...:
89364 - OSTime??
89492 - OSIntNesting
89493 - OSLockNesting  Multitasking lock nesting level
89498 - OSTaskCtr??
89497 - OSRunning
89334 - OSCtxSwCtr Counter of number of context switches
89348 - OSIdleCtr
89344 - OSIdleCtrRun
89340 - OSIdleCtrMax
89491 - OSStatRdy??
89496 - OSRdyGrp?? Ready list group
89495 - OSPrioHighRdy
89494 - OSPrioCur
89350 - OSTCBFreeList

8934c - ???
89490 - ???
